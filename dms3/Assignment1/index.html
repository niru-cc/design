    <h1>Sakura Phoparisut- Mediated Expression Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>Wigglypaint- John Earnest</h2>

    <h3>1. What genre of creative software do you believe it belongs to?</h3>
    <p>A simple art program designed more for the fun of users over professional use.</p>

    <h3>2. List three other examples of software in this genre.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="https://studionokoi.itch.io/shake-art-deluxe">Shake Art DELUXE</a> by nokoi, which Earnest notes Wigglypaint shares similarities with. The rate and intensity of the brush's shakiness can be customised.</li>
        <li><a href="https://kirill-live.itch.io/ascii-art-paint">ASCII Art Paint</a> by Kirill Live. People can draw on a grid via a range of computer characters used as brushes with one character per grid square.</li>
        <li><a href="https://raysberry.itch.io/crossskitch">CrossSkitch</a> by raysberry, where people can dot a small canvas with a pattern that resembles cross stitching. The colours of both the canvas and the stiches can be selected from a small range of options.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. List the program's interactive features/mechanics (one sentence max explanation per feature/mechanic)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Having a canvas and different brushes to use, where all brushstrokes will be slightly animated.</li>
        <li>The ability to save your work on your device as a GIF file in order to preserve the animation.</li>
        <li>An option to change the colour palette of the software from either pre-made palettes or by inputting hex codes, which affects all the original colours of the canvas.</li>
        <li>Ability to customise parts of the program, including adding cards/screens and widgets, due to the software being built in Decker.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its conventions?</h3>
    <p>
        The idea of the program with the wiggly lines show that the purpose of the program is more to have fun than anything serious. The software doesn't provide users with a whole lot of tools beyond the basics.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h3>
    <p>
        The ability to make blank areas of the canvas transparent isn't often found in casual drawing programs such as these. It also adds a "mask" tool to the toolbar to mark parts of the canvas that will not turn out transparent.
    </p>

    <h3>6. What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?</h3>
    <p>
        The amount of colours actually allowed on the canvas at one time is limited to five in total, including the basic pen tool and blank areas of the canvas, so there could be an option to get more colours. Other than that, a layer feature could also be added- currently, the program makes it so that when you use a coloured marker over a pen, the pen colour will remain over the colour of the marker.
    </p>

    <h3>7. What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what indicates this?</h3>
    <p>
        The program Wigglypaint was built on, Decker, was also created by John Earnest. There is a community for Decker that is still active, and Earnest has hosted two jams for software made with Decker. Wigglypaint was a submission for one of these, so its primary niche would be that community and  in general. people on the site who take interest in it.
    </p>

    <h3>8. What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</h3>
    <p>
        In the top bar are tools for editing parts of the program because it was created on Decker. Some of these features, like the Select tool, sound like ones which can be found in many other art programs, so it was initially confusing to me how they were meant to be used on the canvas when they were really just supposed to be tools for building the software itself.
    </p>

    <h3>9. What did you find enjoyable about interacting with it?</h3>
    <p>
        Beyond the concept of the software, the way the UI has a more casual look to it and the addition of fitting sound effects makes it feel less serious than an actual professional art program. I found that this made it easier for me to just draw whatever I felt like drawing without putting too much thought into it.
