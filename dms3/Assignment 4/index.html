    <h1>Assignment 4- Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Judgments of purpose: Your desired outcome for the project - what did you want it to do?</h2>
        <p>I wanted to offer a customisable space to mess around with a small art program with limited functionality. Specifically, being able to create and move around lines and dots that were connected to each other. </p>
    
    <h2>Judgments of worth: What values, besides novelty, were important for the project?</h2>
        <p>I wanted to focus on simplicity, partially because of my own inexperience with JavaScript as well as my genuine interest in how people would use extremely basic programs like these to create works that are unexpectedly complex- for example, how people create artworks on graph calculators. With the simple idea of the program, it had very limited features. I figured that would make it easy for users to figure out what each button does in a short amount of time without getting confused.</p> 
        <p>While working on the project, I implemented a feature to change up the style of the background like I had suggested in my project proposal. I just thought this was a fun idea, but it ended up being a bigger part of the program in my eyes. I initially viewed just the canvas as the medium for self expression, but it expanded to include the aesthetics of the site as a workspace in general as I was working on that feature. Even before I worked on the backgrounds, I set the site to use a lot of blues in the placeholder colour palette because I just liked the colour. So, I would say that aesthetics ended up being a more important value of the project than I thought it would be, too.</p>

    <h2>Judgments of framing: What were the limitations (conceptual and/or technical) you placed on the project's design space?</h2>
        <p>Many of the limitations stemmed from my own lack of experience in working with JavaScript. I wanted to keep the concept of the program simple because of it, so with the core idea of the program users were only permitted to place two kinds of shapes on the board. Even then, the main function I wanted was so unexpectedly complex to implement, so I had to simplify it from the initial idea which I do regret. Other than that, I tried to get the layout of the screen to look right, however I did not account for larger screen sizes. With the images used for the backgrounds, I opted to go for 1920x1080 as that was both the size I was working with and one of the most common ones. Given the time I spent working on these features, there was not enough time to implement sound into the site either.</p>

    <h2>Judgments of appearance: What were your choices and intentions in relation to the style/character/aesthetics of the project?</h2>
        <p>The main thing I kept in mind when I was working on the visuals of the site was to keep it simple and easy to understand. I made the canvas have a corkboard pattern because I hoped that it would help to communicate an idea of what the program was about, alongside the labels on the toolbox. Something I would change here is the order of the buttons, because adding the pins should have probably gone above the string buttons. There's also an empty bar at the top that was from when there was a bar for extra tools that did not get in. I left it there because I thought the space looked too empty with only the canvas and moved it upwards.</p>
        <div>
            <img src="img/current.png">
        </div>
        <p>Regarding the string buttons, I think having them being different sizes worked well enough since using one of the buttons would tell people what it does and there's only one possible setting for the stroke width at a time so it's reversible. However, they were done like that because I planned to put icons like this over them in those different sizes to support the idea of the lines being like threads or string. However, I did not add this in the end because even if I clicked on the transparent portion of the image, it would still count as clicking the image and not the button.</p> 
        <div id="small"><img src="img/s.jpg" id="btn"></div>
        <p>I did realise I could have made it so clicking on the images would register a click on the buttons themselves, but unfortunately I remembered this on the day of the presentation so it was too late actually add in.</p>
        <p>Since the first background was the one people were going to be loading into, I kept the colour plain and matching the corkboard. The options after that are all generally varied and I made both the top and side bars change colours as well to match the background images. Although the images themselves were pretty basic, I made the bars more varied in colour to help all the options look more unique. Overall, I think the focus on variety of both colours and patterns helped show that the program was just for fun. </p>
    
    <h2>Judgments of quality: What choices did you make about the technical implementation of the project?</h2>
        <p>The project was to be made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to use the plugin Konva to help me with creating the main function. There were two features of Konva taht made me want to utilise it for my project. The first was layers, which I figured would work similar to art programs in the sense that shapes could be made to always be in front or behind each other. The second was the ability to edit the attributes of these shapes, which included lines and circles. The ability to change the colours and size, as well as being able to make the shapes draggable, fit the premise of the project. I later also discovered that a drop shadow could be added to the shapes, just like in CSS, which I used to help give a sense of depth to the canvas. I think this was a good choice, as it was mentioned in the feedback I recieved. Since I was in the process of figuring out how JavaScript worked, I tried using similar lines of logic for different parts of the code. For example, I looked at the way arrays were used to store data for undoing and tried using one to get the software to "remember" a limited number of pins to be selected. This did not work, and I ended up having to stick with an even more simplified feature for the core idea than what I was going for due to time constraints. A more successful example of this would be how I looked at how the function for changing the width of the lines stroke was implemented. I used basically the exact same logic for the feature to change the backgrounds, and it worked. It was easy to implement, but also long, which is why I decided to keep it in a different script for my own convinience.</p>

    <h2>Judgments of composition: How did you balance the project as a gestalt whole?</h2>
        <p></p>
    
    <h2>Judgments of navigation: What did you choose to prioritise during your project's development?</h2>
        <p>Since it was far more complex than I thought it would be, a lot of my time was taken up by just trying to get the main function to work properly. Although it was just enough to actually function, I still feel like I spent too much time on it. I did take some time out of those weeks to try and implement functions such as undoing, in part because I incorrectly thought I had promised features like these in the proposal. After the main function was complete, I instead focused time on the feature for switching backgrounds in the end since taht was actually in the presentation. Because it was very easy to implement, I did go back to try and work on saving and undoing- however, I found out that the way I was using Konva, particularly the stage and layers, for the project caused issues with implementing these functions that would have otherwise worked just fine. I had time to find this out, but not enough to figure out a workaround since the one on the Konva site did not work.</p>
