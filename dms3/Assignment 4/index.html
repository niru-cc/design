    <h1>Assignment 4- Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Judgments of purpose: Your desired outcome for the project - what did you want it to do?</h2>
        <p>I wanted to offer a customisable space to mess around with a small art program with limited functions.</p>
    <h2>Judgments of worth: What values, besides novelty, were important for the project?</h2>
        <p>I wanted to focus on simplicity, partially because of my own inexperience with JavaScript as well as my genuine interest in how people would use extremely basic programs like these to create things that are unexpectedly complex- for example, how people create artworks on graph calculators. With the simple idea of the program, it had very limited functions. I figured that would make it easy for users to figure out what each button does in a short amount of time without getting confused.</p> 
        <p>While working on the project, I implemented a feature to change up the style of the background like I had suggested in my project proposal. I just thought this was a fun idea, but it ended up being a bigger part of the program in my eyes. I initially viewed just the canvas as the medium for self expression, but it expanded to include the aesthetics of the site as a workspace in general as I was working on that feature. Even before I worked on the feature, I set the site to use a lot of blues in the placeholder colour palette because I just liked the colour. So, I would say that aesthetics ended up being a more important value of the project than I thought it would be, too.</p>

    <h2>Judgments of framing: What were the limitations (conceptual and/or technical) you placed on the project's design space?</h2>
        <p>Many of the limitations stemmed from my own lack of experience in working with JavaScript. I wanted to keep the concept of the program simple because of it, so with the core idea users were only permitted to place two kinds of shaped on the board.</p>
    <h2>Judgments of appearance: What were your choices and intentions in relation to the style/character/aesthetics of the project?</h2>
        <p>Because the main feature for the site involved a canvas, that took up the most space, with a toolbar off to the side containing everything else that was needed. The idea of the project stemming from embroidery and working with things like strings/fabric lead me to </p>
    <h2>Judgments of quality: What choices did you make about the technical implementation of the project?</h2>
        <p>The project was to be made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose to use the plugin Konva to help me with creating the main function. There were two features of Konva taht made me want to utilise it for my project. The first was layers, which I figured would work similar to art programs in the sense that shapes could be made to always be in front or behind each other. The second was the ability to edit the attributes of these shapes, which included lines and circles. The ability to change the colours and size, as well as being able to make the shapes draggable, fit the premise of the project. I later also discovered that a drop shadow could be added to the shapes, just like in CSS, which I used to help give a sense of depth to the canvas. I think this was a good choice, as it was mentioned in the feedback I recieved. Since I was in the process of figuring out how JavaScript worked, I tried using similar lines of logic for different parts of the code. For example, I looked at the way arrays were used to store data for undoing and tried using one to get the software to "remember" a limited number of pins to be selected. A more successful example of this would be how I looked at how the function for changing the width of the lines stroke was implemented. I used basically the exact same logic for the feature to change the backgrounds, and it worked.</p>

    <h2>Judgments of composition: How did you balance the project as a gestalt whole?</h2>
        <p>I started out viewing just the board as the place where users could express themselves.</p>
    <h2>Judgments of navigation: What did you choose to prioritise during your project's development?</h2>
        <p>Since it was far more complex than I thought it would be, a lot of my time was taken up by just trying to get the main function to work properly. Although it was just enough to actually function, I still feel like I spent too much time on it. I did take some time out of those weeks to try and implement functions such as undoing, in part because I incorrectly thought I had promised features like these in the proposal. After the main function was complete, I instead focused time on the feature for switching backgrounds in the end since taht was actually in the presentation. Because it was very easy to implement, I did go back to try and work on saving and undoing- however, I found out that the way I was using Konva, particularly the stage and layers, for the project caused issues with implementing these functions that would have otherwise worked just fine. I had time to find this out, but not enough to figure out a workaround.</p>

        Your writing should address the choices you made, including negative ones (things you chose not to do or include), and how/if these judgments changed over time.
