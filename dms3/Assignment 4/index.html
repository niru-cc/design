    <h1>Assignment 4- Reflection</h1>
    <h2>Judgments of purpose: Your desired outcome for the project - what did you want it to do?</h2>
        <p>Offer a customisable space to mess around with a small art program with limited functions</p>
    <h2>Judgments of worth: What values, besides novelty, were important for the project?</h2>
        <p>Like, fun or something.</p>
    <h2>Judgments of framing: What were the limitations (conceptual and/or technical) you placed on the project's design space?</h2>
        <p>Well, the fact is that you could only place two kinds of shapes on the canvas.</p>
    <h2>Judgments of appearance: What were your choices and intentions in relation to the style/character/aesthetics of the project?</h2>
        <p>I wanted it to stay, I don't know, lighthearted? "The value of fun, or something." </p>
    <h2>Judgments of quality: What choices did you make about the technical implementation of the project?</h2>
        <p>I don't. understand??</p>
    <h2>Judgments of composition: How did you balance the project as a gestalt whole?</h2>
        <p>I ended up placing some more emphasis on the aesthetics due to the implementation of the background colour palettes?</p>
    <h2>Judgments of navigation: What did you choose to prioritise during your project's development?</h2>
        <p>Getting the main function to work</p>
        <p>
        Your writing should address the choices you made, including negative ones (things you chose not to do or include), and how/if these judgments changed over time.
        </p>
        <p>
        Your written reflections and any supporting media (screenshots or recordings) need to be collated and presented as a web page by writing them into a single HTML document using semantically appropriate elements with a linked CSS file to provide contextually appropriate styling. The finished web page should be uploaded to your GitHub Pages repository and then its URL submitted here on Canvas.
